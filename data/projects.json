      "longDescription": "Developed as part of the Open Avenues Build Foundation program. Programmed an FPGA in Verilog to control LED dimmers using pulse width modulation (PWM) and pulse frequency modulation techniques. Utilized Icarus and GTKWave simulation software for testing and verification. Implemented the system on an Efinix Xyloni development board. Produced a comprehensive presentation on the process, results, and projected applications of FPGA-based PWM signal control.",
